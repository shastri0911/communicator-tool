1. Negation template:
   -----------------
	Ex1: She does not come here.
		=> Even though if we dont provide link between "not" and "come" sentence is generated.
		So, kept only node info of "not"
	Ex2: Do not waste time.
		=> Here cvarsort="i" whereas in above case cvarsort="e"
		So, to use template commonly in both cases modified template by keeping sortinfo empty as shown:
		<node cfrom="-1" cto="1" nodeid="?1"><gpred>neg</gpred><sortinfo  /></node>
