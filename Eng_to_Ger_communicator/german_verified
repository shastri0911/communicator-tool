I have a big dog.
He is good.
Ken was running.
Tom is sleeping.
I eat an apple.
I watched him.
I bought a car.
He is ill.
I am happy.
I like the actor.
He is poor.
It is nice.
Tom is wet.
The artist is gifted.
He cannot swim.
Tom has not grilled the fish yet.
Ken was not running.
Tom is not sleeping.
Tom is tall.
He works in the lab.
She washed the carpet.
The lion is roaring.
She is cleaning the book.
I supported him.
Mary is snoring.
Tom is drowning!
He wrote a book about China.
Tom danced with Mary.
Tom is a gentleman.
The banana is sweet.
I bathe daily.
The dog is barking.
Tom is strong.
Every ship needs an anchor.
He had lost all hope.
Each building has a name.
Tom has a car.
I like raspberries.
I have been writing letters.
Turtles are reptiles.
Tom does not know her.
I have always hated Tom.
