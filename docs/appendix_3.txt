Concept dictionary
---------------
The concept dictionary represents the concepts and the respective language specific representations for those concepts. Each concept can have one or more than one sense which is disambiguated by the concept ids in the respective language columns. The concept dictionary as of now has Hindi, Eng, German, Japanese, Tamil and Marathi. The first column is the Label which represents the concept and it is unique. Hence, the concept id in the Lable can not be repeated. One of these languages, for a particular concept, may sometimes have 2 different words with 2 different senses and the other languages may or may not have more than one sense for the same concept. In that case, the language which has 2 different senses will have 2 entries with 2 different ids (ascending order) and for the other languages there will be 2 different entries but with same sense id. A specific language may have synonym(s) of a particular concept which can be kept in one column by using "|" as a separator. The prakrti (base form) of row 1 is substituted by a concept.  In other words, the word is disambiguated. For the correct concept id, check the concept dictionary. This file can be fetched in ~/communicator-tool/dic/concept_dictionary_user.txt

There will be other language specific dictionaries where the entries will be the word(s) from the concept dictionary with their respective sense id(s) and their categories based on the idisyncrasies of that particular language. For now, we have the dictionary for English which can be fetched in ~/communicator-tool/dic/concept_dictionary_dev.txt

Note: Check the guideline for how to provide the concept information.
