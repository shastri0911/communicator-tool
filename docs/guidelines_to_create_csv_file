#Guidelines for making csv::
###########################

#Format of csv:
#============
CSV file is divided into two parts:
	a) User CSV
	b) Developer CSV

#Guidelines for Developer CSV:
#=============================
CSV file contains total 10 rows namely:
	1. LWG - Local Word Grouping
	2. ID  - ID no. for each word in LWG row
	3. GNP - [Gender Number Person]
	4. Explicit Realtions from Hindi Parser
	5. Implicit Relations "		"
	6. mass noun/proper noun info
	7. English lemma for each word in LWG
	8. Catagory (PoS) 
	9. Sentence_type
	10.Link relations as per DMRS guidelines

#How to prepare CSV file?
#=========================
As the name suggests CSV file is a Comma Separated Values.
a) Each field in a row should be separated by Comma(,)
b) If a field has no value then only comma need to be typed.

#Description of each rows:
#========================

LWG row:
-------
	Each word and its vibhakti(s) should be written together joined by '_'. 
	If a word does not have any vibhakti then the vibhakti part will be replace with '0'.
	Ex: ladakA_0 , wuma_kA
ID row:
------
	For each word in LWG , id starts from 1

GNP row:
-------
	As the name stands GNP means Gender Number Person
	GNP info of each field should be written in "[]" in the order mentioned and separated by spaces.
	Gender field takes values: m/f/n 
		where 'm' stands for masculine
		      'f' stands for feminine
		      'n' stands for neutral
	Number field takes values: sg/pl
		where 'sg' stands for singular
		      'pl' stands for plural
	Person field takes values: u/m/a
		where 'u' stands for uwama puruSa
		      'm' stands for maxyma puruSa
		      'a' stands for anya
	If any of the above fields are not neccessary then mark the field as '-'
	Ex: GNP info of 'rAma_0' is [m - -]
	
Explicit Realtions row:
----------------------
	Explicit relations from Hindi parser need to be filled. 
	Ex: 2:karwA
	(where 2 id is in karwA relation with the word where we fill it.)
	If the word is verb then fill it as kriyA-TAM

Implicit Relation row:
----------------------
	If implicit relations from Hindi parser are present then we need to fill it as mentioned in explicit relation row.

Proper noun/mass noun row:
-------------------------
	If a word is proper noun or mass noun then fill the field as shown:
		propn	for proper noun
		mass	for mass noun
		
English Lemma row:
-----------------
	Lemma of each word need to be filled. 
	If the word is verb then pattern should be 'Lemma+Tam+Tense'
		where Lemma is a lemma of the word 
		      Tam  takes values ing/en/0
		      Tense takes values pres/past/future 
	If the word is verb and as 'not' then pattern should be 'Lemma+Tam+Tense+not'
	Ex: AvaSyakawA_hE_nahIM	->	need+0+pres+not	
	    A_wA_hE		->	come+0+pres
	    
Category row:
-------------
	Category of each word need to be filled.
	Available categories are as shown:
		noun		n
		verb		v
		pronoun		pron
		proper_noun     propn
		adverb		adv
		adjective	adj	
		wh_adverb	wh-adv 	#Ex: when
		wh_pronoun	wh-pron	#Ex: what
		conjunction	c	#Ex: and
		quantifiers	det	#Ex: the
		preposition	p	#Ex: in
		
Sentence type row:
-----------------
	Type of the sentence need to be filled.
	Ex: 'prop' for simple sentence.
	    'ques' for questionary sentence.

Link relation row:
-----------------
	In relation rows, each word should be tagged with a relation w.r.t its head. 
	if 'karwA' then map the relation as ARG1/NEQ
	   'karma' then map the relation as ARG2/NEQ
	etc.
